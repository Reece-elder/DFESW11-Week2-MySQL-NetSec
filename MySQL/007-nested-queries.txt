Nested queries - 

Queries that use results of other queries to query the data.
Using an aggregate function to give a value (min(Population)) using that value to get the name of it

Get the name of the Country with the smallest surface area 

1) Get the country with the smallest surface area
2) Get the name of this country

Generally used to query info you dont know yet


SELECT MIN(SurfaceArea) FROM country; 

SELECT Name, SurfaceArea FROM country WHERE SurfaceArea = x

Nested query:
SELECT Name, SurfaceArea FROM country WHERE SurfaceArea = ( 
    SELECT MIN(SurfaceArea) FROM country
);


Get the all details of the country with the highest population

1) - Highest Population
2) - All of the details

SELECT * FROM country WHERE Population = (
SELECT MAX(Population) FROM country
);

Question: Get the Name, Continent, Region, life expectancy of the country with the highest life expectancy under 75

1) - Highest LifeExp UNDER 75
2) - Name, Continent, Region, LifeExp of country

SELECT Name, Continent, Region, LifeExpectancy FROM country WHERE LifeExpectancy = (
SELECT MAX(LifeExpectancy) FROM country WHERE LifeExpectancy < 75
);

Nested Queries can only work if the original only returns ONE THING

SELECT * FROM Country WHERE Name = (
    SELECT Name FROM Country WHERE Code = 'CHN'
);

Won't work because the nested query returns more than one record

SELECT * FROM Country WHERE Name = (
    SELECT Name FROM Country WHERE Region = 'Eastern Asia'
);
