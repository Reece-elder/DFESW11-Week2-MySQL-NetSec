Aggregate Functions

- Functions / queries that combine multiple records/values into one thing

COUNT - Count values, return a number
SUM   - Work out the total value of a field
MIN / MAX - Return the Min or max value
AVG   - Returns the average


COUNT 

Returns number of records that match 

SELECT COUNT(field name) FROM table
SELECT COUNT(country) FROM country;

We can also use queries (WHERE) to refine this list

SELECT COUNT(title) FROM film WHERE length > 90;


SUM 

Used to calculate the total value of numerical fields

SELECT SUM(numerical field) FROM table
SELECT SUM(Population) FROM city;

SELECT SUM(Population) FROM city WHERE CountryCode LIKE 'AUS';

how could we work out the population of all cities that are not in Spain ESP 

!= - NOT EQUALS

SELECT SUM(Population) FROM city WHERE CountryCode != 'ESP';


MIN MAX AVG 

Used to calculate the Min OR Max OR Avg value 

SELECT MIN(Population) FROM city;
SELECT MAX(Population) FROM city;
SELECT AVG(Population) FROM city;


If asking for more info: 
SELECT ID, Name, AVG(Population) FROM city;

Grabs the first ID and first name when doing SELECT * and puts it in front, no relation to the aggregate 


GROUP BY
Used with aggregate functions to seperate out functions into their groups 
- Allows us to see the max population per countrycode, rather than max pop for entire table 

SELECT CountryCode, MAX(Population) FROM city 
WHERE population BETWEEN 4000 AND 40000 GROUP BY CountryCode;

Exercises 
- Find the average SurfaceArea of all countries
- Max Life Expectancy
- Min GNP
- SUM of Population from all countries
- Surface Area Grouped by CODE
- Count the names with indepedent year not being null
