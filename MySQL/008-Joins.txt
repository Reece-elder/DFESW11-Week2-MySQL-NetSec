Joins

Joins allow us to combine data from two different tables and bring both sets of data together

GENERALLY you use primary / foreign keys to connect your data 

There are different types of joins you can use, inner, outer, right and left
But we're only going to use inner as it is the default (and most useful) 

With the Pizzeria Demo, Orders 

SELECT * FROM primary_table JOIN secondary_table ON primary_table.primary_key = secondary_table.foreign_key

SELECT * FROM pizzas JOIN orders ON pizzas.pizza_id = orders.pizza_id;

Join the Customers Table to the orders table

SELECT * FROM customers JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id; 



Join the Pizzas table with the orders table, then Join that with the customers table 

SELECT * FROM pizzas 
JOIN orders ON pizzas.pizza_id = orders.pizza_id 
JOIN orders.customer_id ON customers.customer_id;
