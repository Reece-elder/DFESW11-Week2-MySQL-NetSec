CREATE 

INSERT command

INSERT INTO <table name> (field names) VALUES (Values to insert);
You dont specify the id, as this is auto incremented

INSERT INTO pizzas (toppings, size, stuffed_crust) VALUES ('Pepperoni pineapple', 12, true);

INSERT INTO customers (name, email, new_customer) VALUES ('Ainsley', 'ainsley@gmail.com', true);

INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, pizza_id) VALUES (1,1);

We can insert multiple records at the same time, by adding a comma after the values

INSERT INTO pizzas (toppings, size, stuffed_crust) VALUES 
('Pepperoni pineapple', 12, true), ('Hawiaan', 13, false), 
('Four cheese', 10, true);


Deleting data - Removing it from the database

DELETE FROM <table_name>; 
- Delete EVERYTHING

DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE field = value 

DELETE FROM pizzas WHERE pizza_id = 2;

DELETE FROM pizzas WHERE stuffed_crust = true;

Important thing to remember 

You cant delete a record IF a table uses it as a foreign key!! Delete the foreign key record first! 

Exercise 
- Have atleast 4 records in each table 
- Using Delete commands attempt the following: 
DELETE ALL From one table
Delete using one field
Delete using AND (two fields)
Delete using OR (two fields)
