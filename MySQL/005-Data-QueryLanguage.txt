DML - Data Manipulation Language - Creating / changing data

DQL - Data Query Language - Querying and returning said data

SELECT * FROM Table - Returns ALL Data from the table

* - Wildcard, returns all 

SHOW databases;
SHOW tables;
DESCRIBE table_name;

SELECT * FROM film - grab all the fields from film

Only interested in title, length, rating

Allows us to specify what fields we want to see
SELECT title, length, rating FROM film;


I want to see all films with a rating of PG-13

SELECT rating = PG-13 FROM films;

SELECT film_id, title, rental_duration, rental_rate, length FROM film WHERE rating = 'PG-13';
Only see id, title, rental duration, rental price, length


I want to see a film called Shock Cabin 
SELECT * FROM film WHERE title = 'Shock Cabin';


Pattern Matching - Looks for data that matches a pattern - lets us use wildcards

SELECT * FROM film WHERE title LIKE 'Shock Cabin';

Every film with the word Cabin in it, with some or no characters before or after
SELECT * FROM film WHERE title 
LIKE '%cabin%'; 


View every film where length is less than 90
SELECT * FROM film WHERE length < 90;

View every film where length is less than or equal to 90
SELECT * FROM film WHERE length <= 90;

View every film where length is between 100 and 110 
SELECT * FROM film WHERE length BETWEEN 100 and 110

SELECT * FROM film WHERE length > 100 AND length < 110;


Ordering - Order data ASC / DESC by a certain field (Is ASC unless specified)

SELECT title, rating, description, length FROM film ORDER BY title DESC;


Find all films with the word shrek in
less than 110 mins
order by descending by title

SELECT title, rating, length, description FROM film WHERE title LIKE '%shrek%' AND length BETWEEN 150 AND 160 ORDER BY title DESC;


Grabbing unique values - Grabs the unique values of this field and shows the first one
Wont work if using DISTINCT field, regular field
DISTINCT
SELECT DISTINCT rating FROM film;

SELECT DISTINCT rating, DISTINCT title FROM film;


Aliasing AS - Used to rename and modify fields to show data better

Using Aliasing to get the rental price by adding rental_rate and replacement_cost

SELECT title, rental_rate + replacement_cost AS rental_price FROM film;

SELECT CONCAT(title, ' - ',description) AS title-description FROM film;
